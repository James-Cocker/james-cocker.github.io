							<p>I'm James Cocker, a dedicated student currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science at the University of Surrey. 
								This portfolio is a testament to my ongoing passion and commitment to the ever-growing field.
								</p><p>The University of Surrey has immersed me in a diverse range of modules, including Web and 
									Database Systems, Programming Fundamentals (in Java), Computer Logic, and Foundations in 
									Computing. I've also delved into an optional Global Graduate Award on Global Citizenship, 
									promoting various projects such as a blog and podcast - which I'm confident will boost my public speaking skills.
								</p><p>Throughout my journey, I've explored various programming languages. This includes Python, 
									Java, C#, SQL, and even ventured into some ARM assembly language. My strong foundation in mathematics, 
									physics, and computer science, fostered during my A-Levels at Bournemouth Grammar School, has provided me with a 
									solid base for my current studies. I'm also proud to mention that my commitment to the subject has been recognised 
									with the Gold CREST award, an additional research project our sixth form allowed us to persue.
								</p><p>Beyond my academic endeavors, I've actively sought real-world experience in the tech industry. I've embarked 
									on a virtual internship with J.P. Morgan, spent seven months teaching at Code Ninjas, and am currently dedicated 
									to IBM's Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals SkillsBuild learning plan. These experiences have further enriched 
									my knowledge and exposed me to practical applications of computer science.
								</p><p>This portfolio reflects the culmination of my academic pursuits, practical experience, and 
									dedication to the world of computer science. Feel free to navigate through my projects, sorted by language.</p>
