							<p>Firstly, a little bit about Galasa. Galasa is an open source testing framework that enables users to automate testing across various other testing platforms via management tools. For example, you could use Galasa with a Selenium manager to click through your website, then use another manager to contact your backend and ensure your data has correctly updated.</p>
							<p>The reason IBM supports Galasa is due to it's deep integration with ZOS applications. My time in Galasa up to now has been focused on <a href="https://github.com/orgs/galasa-dev/projects/3/views/1?filterQuery=james&pane=issue&itemId=118849977&issue=galasa-dev%7Cprojectmanagement%7C2322">this epic</a>. In a nutshell, it involves taking one or many zipped JSON files, and displaying them in a table with IBM's CarbonUI. These can be navigated through, rendered, and shared to pinpoint errors in tests ran on mainframes via these 3270 terminals.</p>

								This web application is a combination of a habit tracker, journal and social media feed. Our group's was aim to empower vulnerable individuals to achieve their personal goals and keep them on track. It tackles SDG 10 (reduced Inequalities) by providing an accessible platform to set and track goals, share updates, and visualise progress - all whilst simultaneously encouraging SDG 3 (good health and well-being). The app features things such as habit streaks, accountability partners, accessibility features, weekly email summaries, comment moderation via sentiment analysis from Gemini and much more. It also aids in logging worker's tasks and time via our journaling feature.
							</p><p>
								My key responsibilities included managing the project, the habit and feed pages, and the completion of the settings page.

							<p>
								This hackathon project had our team competing with over 500 competing hackers at Encode CLub, London 2025. I'm very happy to say our agentic AI project "TrustIt AI" cracked the top 12 projects and succeeded in the goal of identifying incorrect or misleading information on the web! 
							</p><p>
								My key responsibilities included the prontend design, as well as some help with backend development and prompt engineering.
							</p><p>
								In a nutshell, the project involved 3 agents to:

						<ul style="text-align: left;font-style: italic;">
							<li>(1) Analyse the prompt, then generate questions to verify its claims.</li>
							<li>(2) Collect recent related sources from around the web (which are returned to the user) to answer the generated questions.</li>
							<li>(3) Judge these responses and return the output of true, misleading, or false to the user!</li>
						</ul>

							<h2><a>Data Visualisation Dashboard</a></h2>
							<a class="image fit"><img src="../images/LEO_2.png" alt="" /></a>
							<br>
							<p>This internship project involved developing a dashboard to visualise the LEOScope testbed for STARLINK satellites worldwide. 
								The primary goal was to enable users to easily check the online/offline status of STARLINK satellites in specific areas graphically 
								using a map. The secondary objective is targetted at researchers, allowing users to view and download specific data, such as download 
								speed, within a chosen timeframe. The dashboard has many other features: URL sharing with preselected nodes and time ranges, a dark 
								theme, a small page scroller in the bottom right, a mobile-first approach and more.
							</p>
							<p>This project required me to independently learn and utilise technologies such as React.js, Grafana, and Docker. While working autonomously, I effectively collaborated with my team through bi-weekly meetings and achieved our shared objectives.</p>
 							<p>This dashboard page for LEOScope can be accessed below, however the APIs and data collection methods are still under development - please bare that in mind!</p> <!-- Example link with timeframe: https://leoscope.surrey.ac.uk/dashboard?from=1720825200000&to=1721343600000 -->

							<h2><a>Deri-Dilemmas</a></h2>
							<a class="image fit"><img src="../images/Dermi-Dilemmas.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p>The user will upload an image of their skin disease, and if the machine learning model determines they have one of the 9 skin diseases we are checking for, then it will highlight their problem, give them an overview of what they have, 
								and provide an NHS link for more information. This project was developed at the Royal Hackaway V7 with 3 amazing teammates.</p>

							<h2><a>Students' Union</a></h2>
							<a class="image fit"><img src="../images/WD-CW-EERD.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<p>As a part of my Web and Database module, this students' union full-stack project involved creating an SQL database, then connecting up a simple front end to manage it. This includes being able to add, delete or edit students and societies. For my project, I also handled society recommendations for students. For example, if a student had a hobby of swimming, then they would be reccomended canoeing as it is also a watersport.</p>
