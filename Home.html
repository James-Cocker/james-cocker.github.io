							<p>I'm James Cocker, a dedicated student currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science at the University 
								of Surrey. This portfolio is a testament to my ongoing passion and commitment to the ever-growing field.
								</p><p>The University of Surrey has immersed me in a diverse range of modules - where I am currently on track for a 1st (86%). I am currently enrolled in Web Applications Development, Computer Security, Advanced Algorithms and Further Programming Paradigms. The modules I have completed in year 1 include Web and Database Systems (87%), Programming Fundamentals (99%), Computer Logic (94%), Foundations of Computing I & II (76% avg), Data Structures and Algorithms (86%), Operating Systems (96%) and Software Engineering (76%). I've also delved into an optional Global Graduate Award on Global Citizenship, promoting various projects such as a blog and podcast.
								</p><p>Throughout my journey, I've explored various programming languages. This includes Python, 
									Java, JavaScript, C#, C, SQL, and even ventured into some ARM assembly language. I'm also proud to mention that my 
									commitment to the subject has been recognised with the Gold CREST award, an additional research project our sixth form allowed us to persue.
								</p><p>Beyond my academic endeavors, I've actively sought real-world experience in the tech industry. I've embarked 
									on a virtual internship with J.P. Morgan, spent half a year teaching at Code Ninjas, completed 
									IBM's online, self-paced course on Artificial Intelligence and most recently participated in a summer internship as a full-stack developer.
								</p><p>This portfolio reflects the culmination of my academic pursuits, practical experience, and 
									dedication to the world of computer science. Feel free to navigate through my projects, sorted by language.</p>
